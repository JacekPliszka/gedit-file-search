File Search Plugin for Gedit
=============================
This is a search plugin for Gedit to search for a text inside a directory.

The plugin should work with Gedit 2.16 and higher (that would be for example Ubuntu Edgy 6.10, or Debian Etch, or RedHat Enterprise Linux 5, or anything newer than that).

Note for users of RHEL and Scientific Linux: make sure the "gnome-python2-gconf" package is installed; otherwise the plugin cannot be enabled.
