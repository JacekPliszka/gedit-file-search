File Search Plugin for Gedit
=============================
This is a search plugin for Gedit to search for a text inside a directory.

The plugin was tested with Gedit 3.4.1 under Ubuntu 12.04. It might also work under other versions of Gedit 3.
Note that Gedit 2 and older are not supported by this plugin any more (there is an old version of this plugin available, though, which supports Gedit 2).
