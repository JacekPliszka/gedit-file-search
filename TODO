TODO
=====
- display somehow that search is still running
  - maybe animated icon for result tab?
  - or cylon-style progress bar?
- cleanup search dialog layout (convert to correct GTK layout)
- check encoding of grep output (ie. make sure the lines in result panel are in correct encoding)
- run tests:
  - search through / (or /usr or /usr/share) to find weird corner cases
  - I think there's a bug somewhere when searching through /usr/share on my system (xargs displays warnings)
  - there are also some cases where a result line displays more than one text line...
- implement Edit button in result panel
- fix counting of found matches (it currently counts found _lines_, but a line can contain multiple matches...)
- highlight found text in result panel (like, with yellow background for the actually matching text)
- for every result panel, somehow display search parameters (search text, directory)
  - maybe as tooltip for result tab?
  - or as first line in result list?
- maybe use single-click on result line to open file (instead of double click?)
- implement all the options in search dialog
- make it possible to submit search dialog with Enter key
- maybe improve search directory chooser in search dialog?
  - use some existing widget to choose directory?
- remember options (last search terms, last search directories, search options)
  - remember all this also over Gedit restart
- when opening search dialog, deduce initially-display search dir in a better way
  - it should do "the right thing" yet the user must be able to understand the decision-making way
- check that activating/deactivating plugin works correctly and leaves no cruft behind
- check focus behavior of result list
- add keyboard shortcut for opening search dialog
- fix list of recent directories: suppress duplicate entries like "/tmp" and "/tmp/"
- publish initial version
  - select some license
